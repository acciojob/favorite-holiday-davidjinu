		<p>With over 1,000 islands, Maldives has become a top favourite among tourists, especially as a honeymoon destination. Its white sandy beaches, sparkling blue water, and beautiful sunsets make it a perfect getaway. The best part is that it attracts those who want a relaxing holiday and even those who want to get an adrenaline rush with the many water sports activities available here.

Malé is the capital of the Republic of Maldives and has many attractions that offer a clear glimpse of the vibrant Maldivian heritage and culture. However, do visit the other islands on your trip to the Maldives. Along with the scenic views, the country has many lively markets, fascinating museums, ancient mosques, and popular cafés.</p>

			<li><b>Glowing beach at Vaadhoo Island:</b> Add a twist to your regular beach visit at Vaadhoo Island where the water glows. Sounds like magic but this sight has a scientific explanation. It is a phenomenon called bioluminescence that is caused by light emitted by tiny microscopic planktons. As a defence mechanism against attacks by fishes, planktons emit cool blue light with no warmth.</li>
			<li><b>Rasrani Bageecha:</b> Formerly called Sultan Park, Rasrani Bageecha is a spot filled with lush greenery, lily ponds, and large trees. The peaceful garden also features a lovely fountain that changes patterns and colours.</li>
